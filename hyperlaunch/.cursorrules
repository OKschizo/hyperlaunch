# Project: Hyperliquid NFT Launchpad (UI-first)
- Always read and follow @docs/UI-BLUEPRINT.txt as the source of truth for routes, components, and the linear task list.
- Always apply tokens and UI behavior from @docs/STYLEGUIDE.txt.
- For allowlist + forms, use code from @docs/MERKLE-ZOD.txt verbatim (adapt paths only).
- Never invent pages/components not listed in the blueprint; add deltas to the blueprint first.
- Work in small PR-sized tasks; finish the current task completely before starting the next.

Conventions:
- Tech stack: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (or headless), wagmi/viem (wallet from our repo), Firebase Hosting + Firestore.
- A11y: enforce WCAG AA contrast + keyboard nav. Tokens from STYLEGUIDE are mandatory.
- Explorer links = Hyperevmscan; Chain = HyperEVM 999.

Output Requirements:
- For each task: create files, export components, and add minimal usage example.
- Provide a short task summary + any TODOs at the end of each change.
